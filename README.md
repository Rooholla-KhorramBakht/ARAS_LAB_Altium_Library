# ARAS LAB Altium Library

This is a collection of frequently used components in PCB Designing. This collection is created during my time in <a href="https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/" target="_blank">ARAS CDRPM Laboratory</a>. To use this library, download or clone the repository and use the precompiled libraries located in the Build directory.
## Library Structure
The compiled integrated libraries are located in the build directory. In case of including a new component to this collection, use the uncompiled sources in the root directory. After adding the component, run the recompile commanding the Altium designer. the new integrated library will automatically overwrite the old one in the build directory.
-	Altium_Standard: The standard Altium library.
-	Boards_and_Modules: modules and evaluation boards.
-	Connectors: A collection of frequently used connectors.
-	Diodes: Normal and Fast diodes.
-	Integrated circuits: Different catigories of frequently used ICs.
-	LCD_TFT: LCD and display modules.
-	Miscellaneous: Miscellaneous components like: Jumpers, Screw holes, switches, batteries, etc.
-	Passive_Components: Resistors, Capacitors and inductors.
-	Power_Electronics: Motor driver ICs, Gate Driver ICs and etc.
-	Sensors: Sensors like IMU's, Cameras, inferred and etc.
-	Transistors: Mosfets, BJTs and IGBT's.
