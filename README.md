# ARAS LAB Altium Library

This is a collection of frequently used components in PCB Designing. These collection is created during my time in <a href="https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/" target="_blank">ARAS CDRPM Laboratory</a>. To use this library, download or clone the repository and use the precompiled libraries located in the Build directory. Any contribution is most welcomed and appreciated.
